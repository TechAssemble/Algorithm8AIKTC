# Distance measurement using single:one:camera :camera:

If you want to estimate distance of objects with your simple webcam, then this algorithm(*Triangle similarity*) would be helpful for you to find Distance *from object to camera*, I have provide to two examples, one is simple **face detection and distance Estimation**, other is **Yolo4 object detection and distance Estimation**


## install Opencv-python

- Windows

  pip install opencv-python

- _install Opencv-python on Linux or Mac_

  pip3 install opencv-python

## Run the code

- windows: :point_down:

  python distance.py

  ------ OR ---------

  python Updated_distance.py

### :bulb:_Focal Length Finder Function Description_ :bulb:

```python
# focal length finder function
def focal_length(measured_distance, real_width, width_in_rf_image):

    focal_length_value = (width_in_rf_image * measured_distance) / real_width
    #return focal length.
    return focal_length_value

```

The Focal Length finder Function has three Arguments:

`measured_distance` is the distance which we have measured while capturing the reference image:straight*ruler:. \*\*\_From object to Camera*\*\* which is `Known_distance = 72.2 #centimeter`

`real_width` It's measured as the width of the object in the real world, here I measured the width of the face in real-world which was `Known_width =14.3 # centimetre`

`width_in_rf_image` is the width of the object in the image/frame it will be in **pixels**

### :bulb:_Distance Finder Function Description_ :bulb:

```python
# Distance estimation function

def distance_finder(focal_length, real_face_width, face_width_in_frame):

    distance = (real_face_width * focal_length)/face_width_in_frame
    return distance

```

This Function takes three Arguments,

` Focal_Length` is the focal length, out of the **FocalLength** finder function.

`real_face_width` measures the width of an object in the real world, here I measured the width of a face in real-world which was `Known_width =14.3 #centimeter`

`face_width_in_frame` is the width of the face in the frame, the unit will be pixels here.
